# Minigun Config Folder

This folder holds the default configs for the editor. They're bundled with the editor as defaults, so you can them to inspect or learn the default keybinds.

Minigun loads 3 different configs in the given order:

1. This (aka default) configs as a fallback
1. User-wide configs from `$HOME/.config/minigun`
1. Project-specific configs, located inside the `.minigun` folder at the project root.

More info later.

p.s. mostly influenced by helix
